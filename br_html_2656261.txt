 Rio2016.comHagino was the only returning medalist from the London Games, as he took the bronze in the race four years ago behind Ryan Lochte and Thiago Pereira.This year, he would not be denied, as he held the lead after each turn. He became the first Japanese swimmer to win gold in the event, according to the NBC telecast.Chase Kalisz, who is Michael Phelps' training partner, entered the final with the quickest qualifying time (four minutes, 8.47 seconds) and was expected to take the gold.But off the block, he lagged behind and struggled to stay in contact with the leaders after the first 200 meters, as he was unable to make much progress during the butterfly and backstroke. But during the breaststroke, his best portion of the race, he began to gain some ground. Early into the first turn of the breaststroke, Kalisz moved into second place, but Hagino was still a body length ahead.During the freestyle, Kalisz closed the gap to 0.4 seconds and was gaining ground into the final turn, but Hagino did just enough to hold him off.                      Stats courtesy of Rio2016.com.
