Tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. hasn't played an NFL regular-season game since 2013, but the 33-year-old is working toward a return to the league.   Continue for updates.NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Saturday that Winslow will meet with the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.Winslow last played with the New York Jets in the 2013 season, appearing in 12 games. He made 31 catches for 388 yards and two touchdowns. He missed four games in 2013 while serving a suspension for a violation of the league's performance-enhancing drug policy.In his prime, Winslow was one of the best tight ends in the league. He had 82 receptions for 1,106 yards and five touchdowns in 2007—his only Pro Bowl season. Of course, Winslow's prime was about five years ago. He only played one game for the New England Patriots in 2012, and then came his disappointing season in the Big Apple.It's perhaps a sign of how desperate the Packers are that they're showing some interest in possibly signing Winslow.Jared Cook still hasn't returned to the field after having foot surgery, and the duo of Richard Rodgers and Justin Perillo doesn't inspire a ton of confidence in the passing game. Taking a look at Winslow makes sense for Green Bay, and the team would be smart to explore other options as well to see if it can find any upgrade at tight end.
