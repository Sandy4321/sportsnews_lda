braves get lhp Mader and ss Seymour for Cervenka. good prospects. Seymour is a real speedster.Since the non-waiver trade deadline has passed, the 26-year-old left-hander must clear waivers in order for the deal to be completed.Cervenka is in the midst of his rookie season for the Braves, posting a 1-0 record with a 3.18 ERA, 1.27 WHIP and 35 strikeouts in 34 innings.He is especially tough on lefties, who are hitting just .145 against him.Should Cervenka clear waivers, he will join a Marlins bullpen anchored by closer A.J. Ramos and setup man Fernando Rodney. He'll also become just the second southpaw in their pen along with Mike Dunn.The Braves are the worst team in the National League, and dealing Cervenka is the latest in a long line of trades meant to build for the future.Conversely, Miami is tied for the second wild-card spot with the St. Louis Cardinals, and adding another bullpen option gives manager Don Mattingly more of an ability to play matchups.   Follow @MikeChiari on Twitter.
