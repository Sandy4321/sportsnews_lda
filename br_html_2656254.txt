Rio2016.comTanasan built a big seven-kilogram lead after the first portion of the competition. She was the only lifter to snatch over 90 kilograms.On the clean and jerk, she started with a 106-kilogram lift, which immediately put her back into first place by nine points. She did two kilograms better on her second attempt before failing on her third attempt at 110 kilograms.Indonesia's Sri Wahyuni Agustiani took silver with a total score of 192. In order to get gold, she had to execute a clean and jerk at 115 kilograms. It would have been a personal best by two kilograms—and been just two kilos off the Olympic record. But in two attempts, she wasn't able to complete the titanic effort.For Japan's Hiromi Miyake, her fourth time at the Olympics wasn't a charm. Though she came away with the bronze, her wait for a gold medal must continue.It was a disastrous start, as she failed her first two attempts. One more would have immediately disqualified her. On her third attempt at 81 kilograms, her legs almost buckled, but she fought it out and was able to get the weight up.On the clean and jerk, she was able to put up 107 kilograms on her final attempt, which she rushed after her second attempt was disqualified because of an illegal elbow touch. The United States had a rare participant in the event, as Morghan Whitney King finished in sixth place with a total score of 183. After putting up 83 kilograms on the snatch, she was able to put her first clean-and-jerk attempt of 100 kilograms up. But the following two attempts at 103 kilograms were narrowly unsuccessful. She was the first American in the event since Tara Nott, who won the gold medal in Sydney, Australia, at the 2000 Summer Games.One of the biggest surprises came in the form of Vietnam's Thi Huyen Vuong, who finished in second at last year's world championships. On Saturday, she bombed out of the competition in the snatch stage, as she was unable to record a successful attempt.            Stats courtesy of Rio2016.com.
