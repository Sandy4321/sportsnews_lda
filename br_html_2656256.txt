Logano won the Zippo 200 Xfinity Series race at Watkins Glen International Saturday afternoon.The only driver who could keep up with Logano Saturday at the Glen was his teammate, Brad Keselowski. However, the No. 22 Ford would break a rear sway bar in the final laps and that would allow Logano and his No. 12 Ford to run away from the field. It capped a dominant performance for the Penske Racing driver as he led 67 of the 82 total laps. It was Logano's first Xfinity Series win of the season and his second-straight at the Glen.
