His time of 1:50.23 at the turn was 0.79 seconds better than the world record pace.While he held the lead heading into the 300-meter turn, he faded, allowing the field to catch up and overtake him. At the 350-meter mark, Horton took the lead heading into the final turn with China's Sun Yang bearing down on him. Yang had history on his side, as he took gold in this race four years ago in London.The two stayed neck-and-neck as they pulled away from the group. But Horton stayed strong under Yang's pressure, beating him by .13 seconds.Team USA had two swimmers in the field with Conor Dwyer and Connor Jaeger, but neither were able to make the podium as they finished fourth and fifth, respectively. Stats courtesy of Rio2016.com.
