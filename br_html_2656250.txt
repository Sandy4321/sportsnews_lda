NASCAR.comAfter capturing the pole, Logano was in control of the race from the start, leading each of the first 16 laps.The complexion of the event changed on the 17th lap, however, when the field was red-flagged after a huge wreck that involved multiple cars, including Kyle Busch.The reigning Sprint Cup champion and seven-time Xfinity Series race winner in 2016 was knocked out of the race and forced to settle for aÂ 37th-placeÂ result after this pile-up, as provided by NASCAR Xfinity on Twitter:Another look at what caused the red flag to display. #NASCARonCNBC https://t.co/mNWRrD5WyOâ€” NASCAR XFINITY (@NASCAR_XFINITY) August 6, 2016

Derrike Cope brings out the caution. #NASCARonCNBC https://t.co/rPfACUgXFhLogano had taken back the lead shortly before that, and the 26-year-old superstar never looked back from that point forward.While heÂ led the final 27 laps, it didn't come without some nervous moments, as Brad Keselowski was on his tail for much of that time:For the lead! #NASCARonCNBC pic.twitter.com/M7qIotNtYTâ€” NASCAR XFINITY (@NASCAR_XFINITY) August 6, 2016
For the lead! #NASCARonCNBC pic.twitter.com/M7qIotNtYTLogano's closest competition finally faded with just a few laps remaining, though, when a broken track bar stopped his progress and dropped him to a 24th-place finish:ðŸš— @keselowski looks to have a broken track bar. He was running P2. #NASCARonCNBC https://t.co/xb1DAsNNn7â€” NASCAR XFINITY (@NASCAR_XFINITY) August 6, 2016
ðŸš— @keselowski looks to have a broken track bar.

Wow. https://t.co/FbVgWNpwohâ€” NASCAR XFINITY (@NASCAR_XFINITY) August 6, 2016
Three in a row at @WGI! Wow. https://t.co/FbVgWNpwohLogano has developed into a dominant performer at the Glen, with three consecutive victories to his credit between the Xfinity and Sprint Cup Series.His win at Watkins Glen in the Xfinity Series last season gave him the confidence and momentum to complete a sweep the following day, and he has a great chance to repeat that feat Sunday.Logano qualified seventh for the Sprint Cup Series Cheez-It 355, and if Saturday's performance is any indication, a fourth straight win at the road course may be in his near future.Logano undoubtedly deserved to take the checkered flag Saturday as he led all but 15 laps, however, he admitted that he wasn't convinced he would be able to hang on due to the pressure that was put on him in the latter stages, according to Joe Menzer of FoxSports.com:Brad [Keselowski] gave me a run for my money, that's for sure. He was just as fast as me, maybe faster. I never ran so many qualifying laps inside the car.Â I was running as hard as I possibly could and I wasn't sure if my car would last running that hard, but she held together just long enough. I couldn't be more proud to be here in victory lane.Keselowski ended up dropping back to a track bar issue, and Menard finished second. He may have been able to run down Logano if there were a few extra laps.Despite his strong finish, he admitted that the new pavement was difficult to handle, per Ron Levanduski ofÂ USA Today:Â "The tires were really hard, but the track has a ton of grip and you can use that grip until the tire slips. When it slips, it just tosses the car. There is no margin for error when the tire does loose grip. It's a handful."That could make for a tricky Sprint Cup race Sunday, but Logano, Menard and the other Sprint Cup regulars who ran Saturday may have an advantage when it comes to figuring out how to handle Watkins Glen.Follow @MikeChiari on Twitter.
