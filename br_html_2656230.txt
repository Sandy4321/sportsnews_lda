Here is a look at how the entire 40-car field will look when drivers cross the start-finish line to begin Sunday's race

#CarlEdwards knocks Kyle Larson from the top spot during qualifying at @WGI to claim the #Cheezit355 pole. #NASCAR https://t.co/7MdW8AFT8SNo active driver with at least three career Sprint Cup starts at Watkins Glen has a better average finish than Edwards' 8.4, according to Racing-Reference.info. But he has struggled to seal the deal and take the checkered flag, leading just four laps in 11 career starts at the Glen.The same can't be said for Tony Stewart, who leads all active drivers with five career victories at Watkins Glen. Stewart also won at Sonoma this year, which ostensibly locked him in to the Chase for the Sprint Cup.Smoke qualified third, and based on his success on road courses both this season and over the entirety of his career, he could be the favorite Sunday.Stewart is most likely competing in his final race at Watkins Glen since he is retiring from full-time competition at the end of the season. As Jeff Gordon has proved, though, that is far from a guarantee.Gordon has filled in for the injured Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the No. 88 car in each of the past two races, and he will be behind the wheel once again Sunday. The future Hall of Famer has four career wins at the Glen to his credit, but he failed to reach the second round of qualifying and will start 21st.Despite the mediocre showing, Gordon is seemingly in a great state of mind ahead of the race, as evidenced by his comments courtesy of Watkins Glen International on Twitter:"I'm having fun out there shifting...and turning right!"@JeffGordonWeb will start P21 tomorrow. #CheezIt355 pic.twitter.com/FnACtYaRcm— Watkins Glen Int'l (@WGI) August 6, 2016

And @Mc_Driver did a solid job for @CSLFR95 in 11th, his best starting position of the season ahead of his 200th career start. #NASCARQualifying was fairly clean in terms of avoiding wrecks or dust-ups, but Paul Menard was the exception to that rule.As seen in this video from NASCAR, Menard lost control and got sideways after hitting the grass, which forced him to settle for the 33rd starting position:Uh oh...#PaulMenard goes for a spin during #CoorsLightPole Qualifying. https://t.co/UqoW6sxY9x— NASCAR (@NASCAR) August 6, 2016
Uh oh...#PaulMenard goes for a spin during #CoorsLightPole Qualifying. https://t.co/UqoW6sxY9xJoey Logano is the defending winner at Watkins Glen; he will start seventh. AJ Allmendinger won two years ago, and this may represent his best chance to qualify for the Chase, as the road-course specialist will begin the race in ninth.Road courses tend to bring about unexpected results because of how different they are from traditional tracks, and that could make for an exciting and unpredictable race Sunday.One week after Chris Buescher shockingly won a rain-shortened race at Pocono and potentially turned the playoff standings upside down, drivers like Allmendinger and McDowell have a golden opportunity to do the same at the Glen.Edwards turned in a great performance in taking the pole Saturday, but he is unsure of what to expect in the race itself due to the fact that Watkins Glen was repaved prior to the season, according to Reid Spencer of NASCAR.com:I think [Sunday] is going to be a little bit of an adventure. The new pavement, nobody knows how that's going to go along deep into the runs with tire build-up. I think the braking zones are pretty tough, and it's going to be nice and warm.So, just got to stay upfront, can't make any mistakes. I love road races. They're so much fun. I got to talk to Boris Said, who's basically my road racing coach to start, so that was cool today. Hopefully, tonight I'll get me some good rest and hopefully be very competitive tomorrow.Edwards beat out Larson for the top spot, but the No. 2 starter is happy with taking the outside position in the front row considering his struggles in practice, per Tom Jensen of FoxSports.com: "We changed just about everything yesterday and finally got some grip late in practice. You still could use some more, but it was fun. I didn't think I'd end up second. I didn't even think I ran that good of a lap in the first round."Larson has enjoyed a great deal of success at Watkins Glen in the limited number of races he has run there as a Sprint Cup driver, and he will be a big-time threat to take the checkered flag much like Edwards now that he has a car capable of handling the track.Follow @MikeChiari on Twitter.
