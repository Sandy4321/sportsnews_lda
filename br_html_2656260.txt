At that point, Ye Shiwen's previous world record, set at the 2012 Olympics, looked to be in danger.Hosszu then breezed through the breaststroke without much trouble. On the freestyle over the final 100 meters, the 27-year-old showed a little fatigue, failing to maintain the blistering pace she set. Still, she finished well ahead of Ye's mark (4:28.43).NBC Olympics provided a replay of the end of the race:Hungary's 'Iron Lady' Katinka Hosszú just obliterated the World Record in the 400 IM. #Goldhttps://t.co/BWGaUNiTHM https://t.co/8EGZx4qC2Y— NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) August 7, 2016

That was the most impressive swim I have seen since @rebsoni and her 200 Breast in London! domination. And that was the 1st of 5! #Rio2016DiRado's silver medal was almost an afterthought following Hosszu's historic effort. It was the first Olympic medal for the 23-year-old, and Saturday was the second time she's finished behind Hosszu. They came in first and second in the event, at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Russia.For Hosszu, Saturday was the culmination of a long journey. She competed in the previous three Olympics without getting to the medal stand. She made up for lost time, however, putting together one of the most impressive performances fans are going to see at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio.     "I didn't want to just break the record," Hosszu said, per Yahoo Sports' Pat Forde. "I wanted to crush it."DiRado was more than content to stand on the medal stand one spot below Hosszu, per the Washington Post's Barry Svrluga: "Before the race, I kind of smiled behind the blocks, which I don't normally do. I was like, 'I'm swimming in an Olympic final. I was the girl who was videotaping, and recording all those sessions. And now I get to be up there.'"DiRado announced in June, per USA Today's Nicole Auerbach, she will retire from competitive swimming after the Rio Olympics.
