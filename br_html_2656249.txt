Mudranov gave Russia their first gold of the Rio Games when he beat world champion Smetov with a golden score waza-ari.Pareto was many people's favourite, and her maturity came to the fore as she suffered a difficult opening.Bokyeong is a top-class athlete and the current world championship bronze medalist; her style was always going to create difficulty for the new champion.Smetov was arguably the favourite going into the men's final event, but he had a bad day at the office as the Russian prevailed with steely focus.
