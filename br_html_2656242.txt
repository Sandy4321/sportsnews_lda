UFC Fight Night 92 went down Saturday from Salt Lake City.In the main event, Yair Rodriguez tried to make it five-for-five in the UFC against arguably his toughest competition to date, popular veteran Alex "Bruce Leeroy" Caceres.

Both men are well-regarded, but with a combined record of 5-4-1 in their 10 bouts, both could really have used a win.It wasn't the most stacked card the UFC has ever put together, cable TV or otherwise. But there are always storylines before and after every card, and as usual, the final stat lines only reveal so much. Could the card make up in action what it lacked in name power?These are the real winners and losers from UFC Fight Night 92. Full results appear on the final slide.
