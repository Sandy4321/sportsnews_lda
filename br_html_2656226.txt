Louisville cornerback Cornelius Sturghill will miss the entire 2016 season after suffering a foot injury as a result of a drive-by shooting in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.According to Steve Jones of the Courier-Journal, Cardinals head coach Bobby Petrino explained the incident and expressed disappointment for his player:He was walking down the street. There was a drive-by shooting, and he took off and ran. He all the sudden fell to the ground, and there was a bullet that hit his foot.[...]It's a really sad deal. He wasn't going to go home, then he decided to go home. It's the timing of life sometimes, I guess. It's really a shame for him because he's worked so hard.Petrino also revealed that Sturghill underwent surgery to repair a bone in his foot, and although it went well, he won't be able to play in 2016.Sturghill came to Louisville as a wide receiver in 2014, but he redshirted during his freshman year. He converted to cornerback last season and appeared in seven games, primarily as a special teamer.While he wasn't expected to start as a sophomore, Sturghill figured to receive his first significant playing time on defense, especially after running the 40-yard dash in a team-best time of 4.20 seconds in March, per Jones.With Sturghill on the shelf, juniors Shaq Wiggins and Trumaine Washington are likely to be leaned on even more heavily at the cornerback position.Follow @MikeChiari on Twitter.
