Tennis players who participated in the parade of nations during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Olympics wore the same outfit as their compatriots.However, most tennis players have individual clothing contracts and wear their own kits during matches. So who wore their country's colors best? No player gets to pick the country colors. However, how they choose to wear them separates the best and worst from the rest. The best Olympic outfits reflect national pride yet preserve the player's individuality and style. While there were few plain awful outfits, those who made the worst dressed list missed the mark on what the Olympics are all about: playing for country. If a neutral fan in the stands can't figure out exactly what your country's colors are, then that's an Olympic fail. With national pride in mind, the following are the best- and worst-dressed tennis players at the Summer Games in Rio.
