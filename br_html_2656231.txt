He didn't look unbeatable during his qualifying run, however, leaving the door open for the rest of the field, including Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev.Let's check out the top finishers from each subdivision during Saturday's action, which will get updated with the conclusion of every round.¬†Each table will be followed by a recap of the results.

Rio2016.comThere are two ways to view the qualification round for Uchimura. On one hand, he finished first in his subdivision in the all-around rankings, as expected. Yet he's going to need a much cleaner effort during the final in order to guarantee his spot atop the podium.He's set such a high standard over the past handful of years that observers are usually left searching for even minor mistakes. Alas, Nick Zaccardi of NBC Olympic Talk noted the Japanese superstar's routine on the high bars today featured a rare major error:Kohei Uchimura falls of high bar. Earned a medal on it at last four World Champs.‚Äî Nick Zaccardi (@nzaccardi) August 6, 2016
Kohei Uchimura falls of high bar. Earned a medal on it at last four World Champs.Elsewhere, Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece put together an outstanding display on the rings to edge a highly competitive group that featured five gymnasts with a score above 15. Arthur Zanetti of Brazil, who won gold in the discipline four years ago, finished second in the group.Petrounias, who won gold in both the World and European Championships last year, knows he'll need to take his performance up another notch in the final, as noted by the European Union of Gymnastics:@Petrounias_E after qualification at #Rio2016 #UEGymnastics pic.twitter.com/0Nd3FJsLHu‚Äî UEG (@UEGymnastics) August 6, 2016

He shined on the parallel bars to top those standings and finished third on the horizontal bars. Japan's Ryohei Kato was the only one to come close to matching those pair of results.Larduet's performance in the vault could end up dooming him in the all-around competition, though. Dawn Rhodes of the Chicago Tribune summed up that lackluster showing:Manrique Larduet of Cuba, last year's surprise world silver medalist, had a decent rings set but absolutely botched his vault. #Olympics‚Äî Dawn Rhodes (@rhodes_dawn) August 6, 2016
Manrique Larduet of Cuba, last year's surprise world silver medalist, had a decent rings set but absolutely botched his vault. #OlympicsDespite the slip-up Larduet managed to qualify for the all-around competition, albeit in a disappointing 15th place.Ultimately, Uchimura's fall may end up generating the most attention, but his chances of claiming all-around gold will go up if Larduet doesn't pick up the slack. He was viewed as one of the select few athletes with a chance to take down the Japanese favorite.

Rio2016.comThe United States solidified itself as a contender for the team gold medal by besting Japan's score from earlier in the day during the second subdivision. It was truly a team effort with only one American, Samuel Mikulak, ranking in the top 10 of the individual all-around standings through two rounds.Team USA received strong efforts from Mikulak and Jacob Dalton in the floor exercise, Alexander Naddour on the pommel horse and Danell Leyva on the parallel bars. Dalton also sat inside the top five of the vault heading into the final qualification round tonight.Nick McCarvel of USA Today highlighted the team's more positive, confident attitude this time around, as relayed by Leyva:Difference 4 years makes: US men embracing Olympic experience this time around for #Rio2016. Danell Leyva: pic.twitter.com/onHTaNTPPo‚Äî Nick McCarvel (@NickMcCarvel) August 6, 2016
Difference 4 years makes: US men embracing Olympic experience this time around for #Rio2016. Danell Leyva: pic.twitter.com/onHTaNTPPoGreat Britain's Max Whitlock didn't have his best all-around day. He lacked execution on the vault and horizontal bar while falling below his usual standards in several other disciplines. But he came up with a clutch effort to put himself atop the pommel horse list.Like Uchimura earlier, however, all bad days are relative. Even though his performance leaves plenty of room for improvement heading into the finals, Nancy Armour of USA Today noted he likely still gave himself a chance at multiple medals:Whitlock is having what almost anyone would agree is a rough day. Yet should make AA, PH and FX finals‚Äî Nancy Armour (@nrarmour) August 6, 2016
Whitlock is having what almost anyone would agree is a rough day. Yet should make AA, PH and FX finalsUnfortunately, one medal hopeful won't be able to go for gold after a gruesome injury. Samir Ait Said of France, who was the subdivision's top performer on the rings, suffered a severe leg injury while trying to land his vault.Armour reported a loud crack was heard throughout the arena as Ait Said clutched for his left leg. He was immediately treated at the scene before getting stretchered off to receive further medical treatment. French teammate Cyril Tommasone explained how tough it was to push on after that, per USA Today."It was very difficult, very emotional," he said. "It's very hard for the French and for him. Very difficult."The Rio 2016 organizing committee sent along its condolences after the injury:Stay strong @samiraitsaid1. We have you in our thoughts and wish you a speedy recovery. Lots of love from the Rio 2016 team ‚ù§‚Äî Rio 2016 (@Rio2016_en) August 6, 2016
Stay strong @samiraitsaid1. We have you in our thoughts and wish you a speedy recovery. Lots of love from the Rio 2016 team ‚ù§All told, the United States exited the second subdivision as the biggest winner, both on an individual and a team basis. Great Britain still has several medal chances, as well. But everybody's thoughts are surely with Ait Said as he begins the road to recovery.¬† ¬†¬†

Rio2016.comWhile all eyes were on¬†Uchimura entering the games, Verniaiev stole the show in the third subdivision by qualifying first in the all-around with a score of 91.964.Verniaiev beat Uchimura by nearly 1.5 points, and as Tumaini Carayol of Eurosport pointed out, the margin between the two gymnasts was even greater than the deduction Uchimura received for falling:Verniaiev would have beaten Uchimura even without Uchimura's fall.

On. pic.twitter.com/zF7ZDcsRElThe 22-year-old Verniaiev finished just 11th in the all-around at the 2012 London Olympics, but he has progressed significantly since then.The Ukrainian star won all-around gold at both the European Championships and European Games last year, and he proved capable of knocking off Uchimura Saturday, although he will need a repeat performance when the scores count toward medals.Regardless of how he performs, former Welsh¬†gymnast¬†Harry Owen was taken aback by what he did in qualifying:unbelievable routines from @Verniaiev_GyM üëå #Rio2016 #ArtisticGymnastics‚Äî Harry Owen (@HarryOwen93) August 6, 2016
unbelievable routines from @Verniaiev_GyM üëå #Rio2016 #ArtisticGymnasticsIn addition to qualifying first for the all-around, Verniaiev was first in the parallel bars, and he qualified for the apparatus finals in the pommel horse, vault and horizontal bars.Ukraine barely qualified for the team competition in seventh despite Verniaiev's efforts, which spoke to his teammates' struggles, per Rhodes:Vernyayev has been terrific all day but team #UKR really struggling outside of him. Most of their team scores are in the 43's. #Rio2016 #‚Äî Dawn Rhodes (@rhodes_dawn) August 6, 2016
Vernyayev has been terrific all day but team #UKR really struggling outside of him. Most of their team scores are in the 43's. #Rio2016 #While Verniaiev was fantastic individually, China stood out from a team perspective in Subdivision 3, as it qualified first for the team competition by barely edging out the United States.China was powered by a number of strong performers, including Yang Liu, who qualified in the top spot on the rings.Verniaiev and China may very well have established themselves as the new favorites in the premier events of men's gymnastics, but the pressure of medals being on the line could significantly alter the scores and showings with qualifying now officially in the books.¬† ¬† ¬†
