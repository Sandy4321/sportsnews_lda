Leicester City players who helped the club win the Premier League last season will be riding in style at the start of the 2016-17 campaign.It seems, however, Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri will have to buy his own fancy sports car if he wants to join the fun.According to Adrian Troughton of the Leicester Mercury, Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha spent roughly £2 million on BMW i8s for the 19 members of the squad who won the club's first top-flight title. Caitlin Murray of Fox Sports noted each vehicle set Srivaddhanaprabha back £104,990.That's a nice gesture from a grateful owner. It appears, however, that Srivaddhanaprabha forgot about Ranieri."Some gifts are only for them? Not for me? I want to speak with my owner," Ranieri joked with reporters when speaking about his players' new vehicles, per Mark Crellin of Sky Sports.Ranieri earned more than a present with his work in guiding the Foxes to the title, though, as he cemented his legacy during the run.
