The main event was an all-action bout filled with high-risk maneuvers, but Yair Rodriguez moved to 9-1 in his career and a perfect 5-0 in the UFC after eking out a split-decision victory over Alex Caceres at UFC Fight Night 92 in Salt Lake City on Saturday.Rodriguez's constant pressure and unorthodox attacks made the fight fun to watch.Fox Sports: UFC shared the exciting ending to the wild fight:No more fitting way to end #UFCSLC then with an action-packed flurry of strikes and a cartwheel kick! https://t.co/V1r8ZAiMwA— FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) August 7, 2016
No more fitting way to end #UFCSLC then with an action-packed flurry of strikes and a cartwheel kick! https://t.co/V1r8ZAiMwACaceres handled Rodriguez's style better than any other UFC opponent the 23-year-old Mexican has faced, but he couldn't consistently land enough counters to sway the judges.Caceres is one of the few featherweights athletic enough to evade Rodriguez's highlight-reel shots. Unfortunately, that's just one part of the puzzle.Rodriguez keeps his opponents on their heels with his offense. It would be interesting to see how he performs against someone like Frankie Edgar, who is capable of taking him down.Then again, someone else already has his eyes on Edgar.            Bermudez Dominates Jason and Calls Out EdgarThe co-main event was supposed to be competitive, but nobody told Dennis Bermudez. He dominated Rony Jason with his quickness, explosive takedowns and ruthless ground-and-pound attack.Bermudez opened a nasty gash on Jason's forehead in the first round, and it was downhill from there for the Brazilian.After the lopsided victory, Bermudez had a quick message to deliver during his post-fight interview, via the UFC:Nov. 12 | @FrankieEdgar vs @MenaceBermudez at The Garden? We like! #UFCSLC https://t.co/aaMnrgx4Po— #UFCSLC (@ufc) August 7, 2016
Nov. 12 | @FrankieEdgar vs @MenaceBermudez at The Garden? We like! #UFCSLC https://t.co/aaMnrgx4PoThe UFC 205 card is in both Bermudez and Edgar's home state of New York, so the matchup makes sense. Edgar is coming off a loss to Jose Aldo at UFC 200, so he could be ready and hungry for another challenge.              Results             Analysis and HighlightsIshihara Is Something Else

Japanese rising star Teruto Ishihara is one of the most electric performers in the UFC. He showed off his exciting style and deadly striking with a knockout victory over Horacio Gutierrez.This step-back left hook was the end of Gutierrez, as Fox Sports: UFC showed:Ishihara is a fan of three things. Money. Women. And knocking dudes out cold. #UFCSLC https://t.co/dzEAjsWl20— FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) August 7, 2016

He rarely lets fans down.          Teymur Topples Novelli and Calls Out Sage NorthcuttJason Novelli's defense needs some work. He insisted on blocking David Teymur's left hand with his face, and that didn't work out well, as Fox Sports: UFC showed:BOOM! @DavidTeymur with a VICIOUS knockout of Jason Novelli! #UFCSLC https://t.co/Skok9O490V— FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) August 7, 2016
BOOM! @DavidTeymur with a VICIOUS knockout of Jason Novelli! #UFCSLC https://t.co/Skok9O490VNovelli never moved his head despite being caught multiple times with the same punch. Nonetheless, Teymur has continued to show excellent finishing instincts in the UFC.This was his second straight second-round knockout. After the fight, he called out one of the UFC's brightest young stars, via Fox Sports: UFC:Phase 1: Call out @SageNorthcutt and quote @TheNotoriousMMAPhase 2: ????????Phase 3: Profit#UFCSLC https://t.co/CH8MuGzFgQ— FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) August 7, 2016
Phase 1: Call out @SageNorthcutt and quote @TheNotoriousMMAPhase 2: ????????Phase 3: Profit#UFCSLC https://t.co/CH8MuGzFgQThat would be an interesting fight, but Teymur might be too much for Sage Northcutt at this stage of their careers.          OMG...Tybura

Head-kick knockouts are rare. You almost never see them in the heavyweight division, but when you do, they're memorable.Add Marcin Tybura's finish against Viktor Pesta to that list.Fox Sports: UFC shared its excitement:HEAD KICK!!!! OMG Marcin Tybura just buried Viktor Pesta#UFCSLC— FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) August 7, 2016
HEAD KICK!!!! OMG Marcin Tybura just buried Viktor Pesta#UFCSLCThe final shot was set up perfectly. The preceding shots got Pesta to lower his hands, and then, bang, the kick landed squarely.Tybura rebounded from his loss to Timothy Johnson in his UFC debut emphatically.
